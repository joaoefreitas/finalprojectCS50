### Overview
My project starts when I realize the dificult to find game maps, all they in yours own wiki's, **MyMaps** is the solution to this problem, in it anyone can share a map, it can be a game map, to help players, or a real place, like a natural reserve or a water park, don't have limits! The funcionalits include: After you create your account you can like and deslike another maps and create you own, with an image, a title and a description, people who don't have an account can see the comunity maps and search for one, making possible anyone access all maps. To make my project possible I used 'Python' with 'Flask' to manage the web aplication, 'Jinja' manipulating the HTML pages, and 'SqLite3' for store data
